# SELECTION OF RELEVANT SUBJECTS IN CLINICAL COHORTS WITH OMICS FOR TRANSLATIONAL APPLICATION

## MsC project University of Murcia

Alzheimerâ€™s disease (AD) is a progressive neurodegenerative disorder and the most common cause of dementia in older adults. AD exhibits considerable heterogeneity, and bioinformatics and machine learning techniques have enabled the identification of clinical subtypes based on neuroimaging data, cognitive assessments, and biomarkers. To manage the complexity of omics data, dimensionality reduction techniques are used. These methods transform data into a lower-dimensional space, facilitating the identification of distinct sample groups.

The main objective is to develop a tool for detecting specific sample groups based on the transcriptomics of a complex disease such as AD. The specific goals include implementing the tool to characterize these samples based on clinical and demographic information and functionally characterizing the relevant genes.

A tool was implemented to detect specific samples based on a defined set of AD-related genes. PCA, t-SNE, and UMAP techniques were used to transform the data and uncover patterns in the gene expression matrix. The identified samples exhibited significant differences in clinical-demographic and transcriptomic variables compared to the rest of the population. It was observed that these samples were in a more advanced disease state and displayed alterations in specific biological pathways, such as programmed cell death and mitochondrial dysfunction.

A tool has been developed to identify distinct samples based on specific biological variables. The tool analyzes clinical-demographic and functional biological differences between these samples and the rest of the population. This tool provides an objective basis for diagnosing complex diseases and supports a more effective personalized medicine approach.
